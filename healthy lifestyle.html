   <li> Meditation</li>
       <p>Meditation is a practice activity to reduce stress, improve emotional well-being and enhance attention.
           To start meditation is important to consider a quiet room, get comfortable, start with a short time limit
            and increase the time every session, and bring your attention on your breath. There are so many meditation
            videos where the instructor provide instructions that helps you to stay focus. </p>
       <r> Make your own schedule so you can practice regularly and be patient because this activity takes time to 
           develop.</r>
